//! `StitchCore` - push-first canonical entry point for the stitching engine.
//!
//! `StitchCore` is the M3 unification of what used to be two parallel
//! session APIs: `StitchSession` (pull, batch-oriented) and the former
//! `LiveStitchSession` (push, live-oriented, since deleted). Live sports
//! production is the primary use case, so the canonical API is push-based:
//! consumers call `StitchCore::submit_frame_yuv` / `submit_frame_bgra`
//! whenever a new frame pair is ready, and the core owns the pipeline,
//! readback, director, detection, coverage, and replay ring buffer.
//!
//! Batch file processing layers a thin pull-adapter on top
//! ([`StitchSession`](crate::session::StitchSession)::run).
//!
//! ## Foundation traits
//!
//! `StitchCore` composes the foundation traits:
//!
//! - [`crate::projection::Projection`] - camera-geometry contract; today's
//!   L-shape is [`LShapeProjection`](crate::projection::LShapeProjection).
//! - [`crate::source::CameraInput`] - input-camera-count contract;
//!   [`StereoCameraInput`](crate::source::StereoCameraInput) is the
//!   current impl.
//! - [`crate::detect::detector::UnifiedDetector`] - collapsed CPU/CUDA/Metal
//!   detector contract with `DetectorError` for remote-inference futures.
//!
//! The first two are consumed at construction (see `StitchCoreConfig`).
//! `UnifiedDetector` is wired via `StitchCore::set_detector`; detection
//! runs on every `submit_frame_*` whose frame count is a multiple of
//! `StitchCore::detection_interval`, and raw detections are mapped to
//! panorama coordinates before reaching the director.
//!
//! ## Sub-modules
//!
//! - `types` - error types, config, render outcome, replay frame, recorder traits
//! - `replay_buffer` - bounded-duration ring buffer for replay frames
//! - `render` - submit and render-at-pose methods
//! - `replay_management` - stacked replay recorder wiring (CPU + GPU paths)
//! - `pose` - pose resolution, detection scheduling, panorama mapping
