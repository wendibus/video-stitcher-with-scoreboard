# Universal Scoreboard Designer v2

The shared designer is at `scoreboards/designer/index.html`. It configures Basketball, Soccer, Futsal, Handball, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, Field Hockey, American Football, and Rugby with one versioned state model.

Open it directly for a local preview:

    scoreboards/designer/index.html?sport=american-football

Reco can also open it with `sport` and `recoEditorToken` query parameters. The designer uses a true 1920 × 1080 (16:9) preview canvas and also offers a 1:1 square preview mode. It has two explicit modes: Designer template for reusable layout/branding, and Game settings for one specific match. The default demo placement keeps every element inside that canvas so the full workspace remains visible. The scoreboard, free text, and free logo can be moved and scaled independently. Template changes live under `state.custom` and are reusable across games. Match changes live under `game`, `home`, `away`, and `sport`. Editing guides and selection controls can be shown or hidden. The demo uses the provided Reco logo with the “created with” branding. Drag an element in the preview; use the mouse wheel over it to scale it.

The designer always publishes a version 1 state object. Common fields stay in `game`, `home`, and `away`. Sport rules stay under `state.sport`; the host forwards that object without interpreting it. With a token, Publish to active scoreboard sends the complete state to `PUT /__reco/editor-state` using `X-Reco-Editor-Token`. Without a token, Download state JSON exports the local state. Use the template mode for reusable design defaults and game mode for match-specific values.

## Sport profiles

- Basketball: quarters, one shared team-foul limit, and shot clock; scoring buttons `+1`, `+2`, and `+3`, plus separate `Home + foul` and `Away + foul` controls.
- Soccer: halves, added time, and yellow/red cards; goals are `+1` only.
- Handball: halves, home/away fouls, timeouts, two-minute time penalties, and seven-metre goals; goals are `+1`, with separate foul buttons.
- Lacrosse: quarters, 60-second shot clock, penalties, man-up goals, and timeouts; goals are `+1`.
- Field Hockey: quarters, penalty corners, and green/yellow/red cards; goals are `+1`.
- American Football: quarters, down, yards to go, ball position, play clock, possession, and timeouts; buttons cover PAT `+1`, safety `+2`, field goal `+3`, and touchdown `+6`.
- Rugby: halves, tries, conversions, cards, and sin bins; buttons cover conversion `+2`, penalty `+3`, and try `+5`.

## Adding another sport

1. Add `scoreboards/<id>/` with a schema version 1 manifest, transparent HTML/CSS, package JavaScript, and local assets.
2. Keep sport-specific fields inside that package’s `state.sport` object.
3. Add the default state, field list, score values, and preview interpretation to `scoreboards/designer/designer.js`.
4. Add the sport ID to the designer selector and the package list in `scoreboards/tests/scoreboard-contract.test.js`.
5. Keep the package offline-capable, transparent, accessible, and designed for its manifest viewport.
6. Validate the package JavaScript, manifest, SDK hooks, and sport-specific scoring rules before committing.

Typography is stored under `state.custom.typography`; uploaded images are stored as data URLs so the template remains portable and offline-capable. The universal designer is a reference operator surface. A package may still provide a specialized editor through its manifest `editor` field.
