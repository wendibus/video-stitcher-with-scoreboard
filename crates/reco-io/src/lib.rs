//! Pluggable frame I/O for Reco.
//!
//! This crate provides [`reco_core::source::FrameSource`] and
//! [`reco_core::encoder::Encoder`] implementations backed by
//! FFmpeg (files, network streams), GStreamer (live cameras),
//! and libcamera (Raspberry Pi CSI cameras).
//!
//! Enable backends via feature flags:
//! - `ffmpeg` (default): file decode/encode, RTMP/SRT/RTSP
//! - `gstreamer`: live camera capture (Jetson ISP, V4L2, etc.)
//! - `libcamera`: RPi CSI camera capture via rpicam-vid
//! - `config`: opt-in user-preference persistence (via the `settings`
//!   module) for consumers like reco-gui that need to remember
//!   recent files and defaults across sessions.
