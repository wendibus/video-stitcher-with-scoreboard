//! Field-aware panner. Two framing modes share one motion pipeline:
//! [`FramingMode::Action`] follows the densest player cluster (broadcast
//! style), [`FramingMode::FrameAll`] keeps every player in frame.
//!
//! # Pipeline (per `decide` call)
//!
//! 1. Take the current-frame players from `world.players` (the provider
//!    self-filters by class; `Lost` entities are dropped before
//!    clustering).
//! 2. Resolve the look-at center per [`FramingMode`]:
//!    - **Action** - select the cluster per [`ClusterMode`] (density
//!      peak by default, trimmed mean as fallback), then a (optionally
//!      confidence-weighted) mean + EMA. Edge-push and pitch-bias lean
//!      the aim into the direction of play; an optional ball blend pulls
//!      toward `world.ball`.
//!    - **FrameAll** - the EMA-smoothed geometric midpoint of every
//!      player's bounding box; no trim, no weighting, no biases.
//! 3. Lookahead lead, velocity-clamped chase, and soft dead-zone move
//!    the aim toward that center (mode-agnostic).
//! 4. Dynamic FOV: Action sizes from cluster spread + distance/edge/
//!    velocity biases (widened to keep the ball framed); FrameAll sizes
//!    to the bounding-box extent plus a margin. Both EMA-smoothed.
//!
//! # Logging
//!
//! Following reco's explicit-decision principle: every behavior
//! branch (ball blend vs cluster-only, cluster lost, NaN rejection)
//! emits a log line so an operator can reconstruct the camera's
//! decisions from the log alone.
